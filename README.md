Here I will be posting my codes for my projects in the year 2023

# __Projects__:


- Degree (cellular, physiological, and pharmacological sciences) honours research project (Python):
    - In Python.
    - Takes data collected from an analysis software for biological microscope work (ImageJ) using the clipboard
    - Reorganizes data in the correct format. Split data in two and divides them in the correct format and places.
    - Adds information needed thus eliminating repetitive entries.
    - **Cuts** analysis formatting time **from 3 hours to a few of minutes**.

- Degree (cellular, physiological, and pharmacological sciences) honours research project (Macro in ImageJ):
    - Runs in software ImageJ & is written in ImageJ Macro language.
    - Automates analysis of images by preforming the followed procedure.
    - Analysis on hundreds of images taken on a confocal microscope.
    - Allowed me to analyse 100s of images with one click after putting the images to be analysed in the correct file.
    - **Cuts** procedure preforming time from **~4 hours to a few seconds.**
    - Note: the code was written with the help of a built-in feature in the software & PDFs on the programming language.
